General: I have made this animation to analyse and study the nature of constructive and destructive waves produced by the Double Slit Experiment.
The aim was to incorporate this animation and a simple review of the nature of electromagnetic waves in a paper by title 'Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and the Quantum Future' and submit it for Gold CREST award.
(Faris, Avenija and Nadia participated too)

Specific: The wave function is Sine. It is drawn in semi-transparent lines (balck and red) to show the effect of the wave when interacting with each other (in form of construction and destruction). I have tried to make the code a bit more sophisticated by creating arc of circles instead of full circles.
